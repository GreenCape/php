# GreenCape / PHP [![build status badge](https://img.shields.io/travis/greencape/php/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/greencape/php/branches)

This repository is based on the official PHP images in the Docker library.
The `greencape/php` images can be used exactly like the original, so the documentation of the official PHP images applies here as well.

## So why?

The official PHP images only provide current versions, which in general is fine. However, for testing purposes at most, you might need old PHP versions that are not supported any more.

This repository tries to provide these images. There can, however, not be given any guarantee for fitness for any purpose. USE ON YOUR OWN RISK!

## License

These images are provided under the same [PHP License, version 3.01](LICENSE) as the original images.

As with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc
from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).

As for any pre-built image usage, it is the image user's responsibility to ensure that any use of this image complies
with any relevant licenses for all software contained within.

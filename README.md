# GreenCape / PHP [![build status badge](https://img.shields.io/travis/greencape/php/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/greencape/php/branches)

This repository is based on the official PHP images in the Docker library.
The `greencape/php` images can be used exactly like the original, so the documentation of the official PHP images applies here as well.

## So why?

The official PHP images only provide current versions, which in general is fine. However, for testing purposes at most, you might need old PHP versions that are not supported any more.

This repository tries to provide these images. There can, however, not be given any guarantee for fitness for any purpose. USE ON YOUR OWN RISK!
